"""
Solver problem detail — plan_install's SOLVER_ERROR response should carry
each problem's full detail text and its proposed solutions, not just a
one-line description (worker/src/tools/tools.h: solverProblemsToJson()).
Previously only "description" was emitted per problem; both "details" and
the entire "solutions" array were silently dropped.

Solve-only, no commit — the fastest scenario in the suite and independent
of everything else here.
